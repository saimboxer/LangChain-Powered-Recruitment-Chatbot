# Chatbot for Developer Hiring using LangChain and OpenAI
### Project Overview:
Developed a chatbot to assist HR managers in hiring developers by analyzing resumes.
Integrated LangChain, FAISS, and OpenAI technologies for document processing and analysis.
Key Responsibilities:

### PDF Document Processing:
Loaded and processed PDF documents using PyPDFLoader.
Cleaned and preprocessed text data to prepare it for analysis.
Text Embedding and Vector Storage:
Generated embeddings using HuggingFace's BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 model.
Utilized FAISS for efficient storage and retrieval of text embeddings.

### Document Chunking:
Implemented RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to divide text into manageable chunks.
Retrieval and Response Generation:
Created a retriever using FAISS vector store.
Combined retriever with a ChatOpenAI language model to generate context-aware responses.
Developed custom prompt templates for specific query contexts.

### Environment Setup:
Set up environment variables and managed API keys for OpenAI integration.
Installed and configured necessary Python libraries.
Skills Acquired:

### Natural Language Processing (NLP):
